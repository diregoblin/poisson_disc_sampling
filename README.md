# Poisson disc sampling
Poisson disc sampling in arbitrary dimensions using Bridson's algorithm, implemented in python using ``numpy`` and ``scipy``.

Generates so-called "blue noise" that prevents clustering by ensuring each two points are at least ``radius`` apart.

Implementation is located in ``poisson_disc.py``, while ``poisson_disc_sampling.ipynb`` contains some examples. 

Available through PyPI as ``poisson_disc``, https://pypi.org/project/poisson-disc/

Also, this code is now included in SciPy as https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.qmc.PoissonDisk.html
